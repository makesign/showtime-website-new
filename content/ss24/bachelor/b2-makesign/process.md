At the beginning of the project, we spent a lot of time considering which software, hardware, and frameworks we could use to fully fulfill the tasks of the project. After extensive research, we decided to use Raspberry Pi minicomputers in conjunction with a monitor as the hardware. In doing so, we had to figure out how to set up a Raspberry Pi. Since we wanted to use the API from the IdiA booking system to project all information onto our own website, we had to find an open-source solution.

"Concerto" was our choice for the open-source digital signage solution, which served us in conjunction with "Ruby on Rails" as the software. "Concerto" allows for the creation of a website that can also utilize the API of the booking system, which was exactly what we needed for the development of our project. During this process, we encountered some problems, such as the new development environment "RubyMine" and the new programming language "Ruby on Rails," which we first had to understand and learn so that we could understand the code of "Concerto," which was also outdated and needed to be renewed.

There were many errors in the code that we identified and had to fix through testing. Here, our supervisor repeatedly helped us with difficulties in the code and the tests.

For the design, we used "Figma" to create a quick and suitable design, which we implemented with the CSS framework "Bootstrap," thereby creating the entire style of the website.
